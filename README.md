# Parkinson's disease variants in KOLF2.1J iPSC line

This repository contains scripts used to process multiple different datasets used to determine the regulatory impacts of Parkinson's associated variants in the KOLF2.1J induced pluripotent stem cell line.

# RNAseq analysis (Illumina short-read [RNA])

# Micro-C sequencing analysis

Alignment & filtering scripts based on the publicly available pipeline: https://micro-c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

# Off-target analysis (ONT long-read whole genome sequencing [DNA])

# Methylation analysis
